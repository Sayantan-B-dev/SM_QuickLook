          <p className="os-example">
            In multilevel queue scheduling, processes are divided into different queues based on their priority and characteristics.
            Each queue has a different priority, and processes are assigned to a queue based on their behavior, such as:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>System Processes</strong> - High priority, e.g., operating system processes.</li>
              <li><strong>Interactive Processes</strong> - Medium priority, e.g., user programs interacting with the system.</li>
              <li><strong>Batch Processes</strong> - Low priority, e.g., long-running background tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            The CPU scheduling algorithm is applied to each queue separately, and each queue can use different algorithms like Round Robin (RR) or Shortest Job First (SJF).

          <h2 className="os-subtitle">Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling</h2>
          <p className="os-example">
            In multilevel feedback queue scheduling, processes can move between queues based on their execution history.
            The goal is to allow more CPU time to interactive processes, while preventing long-running processes from monopolizing CPU time. Processes that use more CPU time can be moved to a lower-priority queue. Conversely, processes that are I/O bound can be moved to a higher-priority queue.
          </p>

            - If an interactive process (P1) uses less CPU time, it stays at the high-priority queue. 
            - If a batch process (P3) exceeds its allocated time, it moves down to a lower priority queue.

            - Processes start in the highest priority queue.
            - Processes can move between queues based on how much CPU time they use.
            - If a process exceeds its time quantum or behaves in a way that suggests it is CPU-bound, it moves to a lower priority queue.

          <h2 className="os-subtitle">Key Differences</h2>
          <ul className="os-example">
            <li><strong>Multilevel Queue:</strong> Processes are permanently assigned to a specific queue based on their characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Multilevel Feedback Queue:</strong> Processes can move between queues dynamically based on their behavior.</li>
            <li>Feedback queues provide more flexibility by adjusting priorities based on execution history.</li>

        <div className="os-section">
          <h2 className="os-subtitle">Advantages</h2>
          <ul className="os-example">
            <li>Multilevel queue ensures system processes get higher priority while batch processes get lower priority.</li>
            <li>Multilevel feedback queues ensure that I/O bound processes donâ€™t suffer from starvation.</li>

          <h2 className="os-subtitle">Disadvantages</h2>
