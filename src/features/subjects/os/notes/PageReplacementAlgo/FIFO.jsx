            Belady's Anomaly in FIFO Page Replacement
          </h2>
          <p className="os-example">
            <strong>Belady‚Äôs Anomaly</strong> refers to a counterintuitive
            situation where increasing the number of page frames results in
            **more page faults**, instead of fewer. This behavior is observed in
            the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) page replacement algorithm and is
            considered a flaw because ideally, more memory should reduce faults.
          </p>
          <p className="os-example">
            This anomaly proves that FIFO is **not a stack-based algorithm**
            (unlike LRU or Optimal), where a larger memory would always be a
            superset of a smaller one.
          </p>
          <p className="os-example">
            Let‚Äôs demonstrate Belady‚Äôs Anomaly with an example:
          </p>
          <pre>{`
Reference String: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Case 1: 3 Page Frames
Step-by-step Page Replacement:
[1]       Page Fault
[1,2]     Page Fault
[1,2,3]   Page Fault
[2,3,4]   Page Fault (1 replaced)
[3,4,1]   Page Fault (2 replaced)
[4,1,2]   Page Fault (3 replaced)
[1,2,5]   Page Fault (4 replaced)
[2,5,1]   Page Fault (1 reloaded)
[5,1,2]   Page Fault (2 reloaded)
[1,2,3]   Page Fault (5 replaced)
[2,3,4]   Page Fault (1 replaced)
[3,4,5]   Page Fault (2 replaced)

‚û° Total Page Faults = 12

Case 2: 4 Page Frames
Step-by-step Page Replacement:
[1]         Page Fault
[1,2]       Page Fault
[1,2,3]     Page Fault
[1,2,3,4]   Page Fault
[1,2,3,4]   No Fault
[1,2,3,4]   No Fault
[2,3,4,5]   Page Fault (1 replaced)
[3,4,5,1]   Page Fault (2 replaced)
[4,5,1,2]   Page Fault (3 replaced)
[5,1,2,3]   Page Fault (4 replaced)
[1,2,3,4]   Page Fault (5 replaced)
[2,3,4,5]   Page Fault (1 replaced)

‚û° Total Page Faults = 10

‚ö† Observation: Adding one more frame (from 3 to 4) caused page faults to DROP from 12 ‚Üí 10 ‚Äî this is expected.

Now consider another version:

Reference String: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

With 3 Frames ‚Üí Page Faults = 9  
With 4 Frames ‚Üí Page Faults = 10 ‚Üê ‚ùó Belady's Anomaly detected here!

          <p className="os-example">
            üîç <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Belady‚Äôs Anomaly can lead to worse
            performance in FIFO if memory size increases, which is why modern
            systems prefer algorithms like LRU or Optimal that don‚Äôt suffer from
            this issue.
