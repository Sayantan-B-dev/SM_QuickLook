          <h2 className="se-subtitle">1. Statement Coverage</h2>
          <p className="se-example">
            Statement coverage is a white-box testing technique that ensures every line of code is executed at least once during testing.
          </p>
          <h2 className="se-subtitle">Formula</h2>
          <pre>{`
Statement Coverage (%) = 
(Number of statements executed / Total number of statements) Ã— 100
          `}</pre>

          <h2 className="se-subtitle">2. Condition Coverage</h2>
          <p className="se-example">
            Condition coverage ensures that each Boolean sub-expression in a decision is evaluated to both TRUE and FALSE at least once.
          </p>
          <pre>{`
Example:
if (A && B)
Condition coverage ensures:
- A is TRUE and FALSE
- B is TRUE and FALSE

        <div className="se-section">
          <h2 className="se-subtitle">3. Data Flow Testing</h2>
          <p className="se-example">
            Data flow testing focuses on the points at which variables receive values and the points at which these values are used. It helps detect improper use of variables and ensures that data is correctly initialized and used.

Code:
1. int a = 5;
