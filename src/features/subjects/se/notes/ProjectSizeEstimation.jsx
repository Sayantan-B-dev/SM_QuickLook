          <h2 className="se-subtitle">What is Project Size Estimation?</h2>
          <p className="se-example">
            Project size estimation helps determine the scope and effort
            required to build a software system. It influences planning,
            scheduling, and resource allocation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="se-section">
          <h2 className="se-subtitle">Function Point (FP)</h2>
          <p className="se-example">
            Function Point is a unit of measurement to express the amount of
            business functionality an information system provides to a user.
            It is independent of the programming language and measures size
            based on user-visible features.
          </p>
          <pre>{`
FP = UFP Ã— CAF
Where:
UFP = Unadjusted Function Points (based on number of inputs, outputs, inquiries, files, and interfaces)
CAF = Complexity Adjustment Factor (based on 14 general system characteristics)`}</pre>
        </div>

        <div className="se-section">
          <h2 className="se-subtitle">Lines of Code (LOC)</h2>
          <p className="se-example">
            LOC measures the size of software by counting the number of lines
            in the source code. It's language-dependent and used for effort
            and cost estimation.
          </p>
          <pre>{`
LOC includes:
- Executable lines
- Data definitions
- Comments (sometimes excluded)

Example:
int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
// 3 lines of code (if comments included)`}</pre>
