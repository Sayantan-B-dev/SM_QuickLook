          <p className="text-grey-400">
            CSMA stands for <strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access</strong>. It
            is a network protocol that listens to a channel before transmitting.
            The sender senses the medium to detect if it's idle or busy. If
            idle, the data is transmitted; otherwise, it waits. It reduces
            collisions compared to ALOHA but doesnâ€™t eliminate them.

                - If the channel is idle, the station transmits immediately with
                100% probability (p=1).
                <br />
                - If the channel is busy, the station continuously senses until
                it becomes idle, then transmits.
                <br />
                <strong>Advantage:</strong> Simple and ensures quick
                transmission.
                <br />
                <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> High collision chance if multiple
                nodes wait for the channel to become free.

                - If the channel is busy, the station waits for a random time

                - If idle, it transmits immediately.
                <br />- <strong>Advantage:</strong> Reduces chances of
                collision.
                <br />- <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Increases delay and idle
                time.

                - Applicable only in slotted channels.
                <br />
                - When the channel is idle, the station transmits with
                probability p, and waits for the next slot with probability
                (1-p).
                <br />
                - If the channel is busy, it defers until idle again.
                <br />
                <strong>Advantage:</strong> Balances collision risk and delay
                using tunable probability.
                <br />
                **<strong>Disadvantage:</strong> More complex and less optimal
