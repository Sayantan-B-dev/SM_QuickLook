          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Routers: Comprehensive Explanation</h2>

          <p className="cn-example">
            A <strong>Router</strong> is a networking device that forwards data
            packets between different networks. Routers operate at Layer 3 of
            the OSI model, known as the <strong>Network Layer</strong>, and use
            IP addresses to determine the best path for forwarding the data.
            Routers typically connect local area networks (LANs) to wide area
            networks (WANs) or to the internet.
          </p>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Functionality of Routers</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>
              <strong>Packet Forwarding:</strong> Routers forward data packets
              based on their destination IP addresses. The process is done using
              routing tables or routing protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Path Selection:</strong> Routers determine the best path
              for data transmission, considering factors like network topology,
              traffic conditions, and reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Traffic Segmentation:</strong> Routers divide networks
              into smaller segments (subnets) to improve network efficiency and
              organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Network Address Translation (NAT):</strong> Routers can
              perform NAT, translating private IP addresses to public IP
              addresses and vice versa, allowing multiple devices on a local
              network to share a single public IP address.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Routing Tables</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            Routers maintain a <strong>Routing Table</strong> to store
            information about the routes to different network destinations. Each
            entry in the table typically consists of:
            <ul className="cn-example">
              <li>
                <strong>Destination Network:</strong> The network address of the
                destination.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Next Hop:</strong> The address of the next router or
                device on the path.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interface:</strong> The router's interface through which
                the data packet should be forwarded.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Metric:</strong> The cost associated with the route,
                often based on factors like hop count, bandwidth, or delay.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Types of Routers</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>
              <strong>Core Routers:</strong> High-performance routers that
              operate at the backbone of a network, typically handling large
              volumes of data across high-speed connections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Edge Routers:</strong> Routers located at the edge of the
              network, usually connecting the internal network to external
              networks such as the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Branch Routers:</strong> Routers used in smaller, remote
              locations to connect branch offices to the main network or
              internet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Virtual Routers:</strong> Software-based routers that
              simulate the functionality of a physical router and are often used
              in virtualized environments.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Routing Protocols</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>
              <strong>RIP (Routing Information Protocol):</strong> A
              distance-vector protocol used to determine the best path based on
              hop count, typically used in smaller networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):</strong> A link-state
              protocol that uses a more sophisticated method of path selection
              based on factors like bandwidth and network topology.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):</strong> A path-vector
              protocol used to exchange routing information between different
              autonomous systems, typically used on the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):
              </strong>{" "}
              A Cisco-proprietary hybrid protocol that combines the benefits of
              both distance-vector and link-state protocols.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Static vs Dynamic Routing</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>
              <strong>Static Routing:</strong> Involves manually configuring the
              router with predefined routes. It is simpler but lacks flexibility
              and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Routers automatically adjust
              their routes based on network conditions. This method uses routing
              protocols like RIP, OSPF, or BGP to dynamically update the routing
              table.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Routing Metrics</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            Routing metrics are used to determine the best path for forwarding
            packets. Common metrics include:
            <ul className="cn-example">
              <li>
                <strong>Hop Count:</strong> The number of intermediate devices
                (routers) a packet passes through.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bandwidth:</strong> The capacity of the link; routers
                prefer paths with higher bandwidth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Delay:</strong> The time it takes for a packet to travel
                from source to destination.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Load:</strong> The amount of traffic on a network link;
                routers prefer less congested paths.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reliability:</strong> The dependability of a link based
                on factors like error rates and downtime.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Advantages of Routers</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>Facilitate the interconnection of different networks.</li>
            <li>
              Enable routing based on IP addresses, which makes them more
              scalable than Layer 2 devices like switches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide security through NAT, firewalls, and access control lists
              (ACLs).
            </li>
            <li>Support large, complex network topologies with flexibility.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Disadvantages of Routers</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>
              Higher cost compared to simpler devices like hubs or switches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Can introduce delays and increase latency due to the routing
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Require more complex configuration and maintenance, especially in
              large networks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Use Cases</h2>
          <ul className="cn-example">
            <li>
              Connecting different subnets within a large enterprise network.
            </li>
            <li>Interconnecting local networks to the internet.</li>
            <li>

- Each subnet is on a separate network segment, connected by the router.
