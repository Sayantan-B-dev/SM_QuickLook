          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Introduction to VPNs</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that allows users to securely connect to a remote network over the internet. It creates a private, encrypted connection that masks the user's IP address, ensuring that the communication remains confidential and safe from potential threats.

        <div className="cn-section">
          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Types of VPNs</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            There are several types of VPNs, each serving different purposes:
          </p>
          <ul className="cn-example list-disc pl-6">
            <li><strong>Remote Access VPN:</strong> Used by individuals to connect to a private network from a remote location. Common in personal use or for employees accessing a corporate network.</li>
            <li><strong>Site-to-Site VPN:</strong> Used to connect two or more networks securely over the internet, often used for inter-office communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Client-to-Site VPN:</strong> A variant of remote access VPN where the client accesses a specific private network.</li>
            <li><strong>SSL VPN:</strong> A web-based VPN solution using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure communication. It works via a web browser, making it easier to implement.</li>
            <li><strong>IPsec VPN:</strong> Uses Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) to create encrypted connections between devices and networks, commonly used in site-to-site and remote access VPNs.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        {/* How VPN Works Section */}
        <div className="cn-section">
          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">How a VPN Works</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            VPNs work by creating a secure tunnel between the user's device and a VPN server. This tunnel is established using different tunneling protocols, such as PPTP, L2TP, IPSec, or SSL. Once the tunnel is created, data is encrypted and transmitted over the internet, making it unreadable to third parties.
          </p>
          <p className="cn-example">
            The process typically involves:
          </p>
          <ul className="cn-example list-disc pl-6">
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data sent over the VPN is encrypted using secure protocols like AES, ensuring confidentiality.</li>
            <li><strong>Tunneling:</strong> The VPN creates a secure tunnel by encapsulating the data within packets, which are transmitted securely over the public network.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Both the user and the VPN server authenticate each other using certificates, pre-shared keys, or username and password combinations.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> The integrity of the data is maintained by verifying that the data has not been altered during transmission, often achieved with hashing algorithms like SHA-256.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        {/* VPN Data and Metadata Section */}
        <div className="cn-section">
          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">Data and Metadata in VPN</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            When using a VPN, the following data is transmitted:
          </p>
          <ul className="cn-example list-disc pl-6">
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> This refers to the actual information being transmitted, such as emails, files, or browsing data. The VPN encrypts this data to protect it from being intercepted.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Metadata refers to the information about the data, such as IP addresses, connection timestamps, and data sizes. While VPNs protect the content of the data, they do not always hide metadata, although some VPNs offer "no-log" policies to minimize this exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption Keys:</strong> The keys used to encrypt and decrypt the data are critical to the VPN’s security. These keys are typically based on algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        {/* VPN Protocols Section */}
        <div className="cn-section">
          <h2 className="cn-subtitle">VPN Protocols</h2>
          <p className="cn-example">
            Various protocols are used to establish and secure VPN connections. The most commonly used VPN protocols include:
          </p>
          <ul className="cn-example list-disc pl-6">
            <li><strong>PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):</strong> One of the oldest VPN protocols, PPTP is easy to set up but offers less security compared to other protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol):</strong> Often paired with IPsec for security, L2TP offers better security than PPTP but can be slower.</li>
            <li><strong>IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):</strong> Commonly used with L2TP or as a standalone protocol, IPsec ensures data integrity and confidentiality by encrypting the data and authenticating the source.</li>
            <li><strong>SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security):</strong> SSL/TLS is commonly used for SSL VPNs and is particularly good for remote access as it works over HTTPS (port 443).</li>
            <li><strong>OpenVPN:</strong> An open-source VPN protocol known for its strong security and flexibility. It supports both UDP and TCP ports, making it adaptable for different network environments.</li>
            <li><strong>IKEv2/IPsec:</strong> A highly secure and fast protocol often used for mobile devices. IKEv2 is resistant to network changes, making it ideal for mobile VPNs.</li>
          </ul>
