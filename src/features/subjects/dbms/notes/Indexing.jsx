          <p>
            Indexing is a technique used in databases to speed up the retrieval of rows from a table. An index is a data structure that allows the database to locate data efficiently. It works similarly to an index in a book, where you can quickly find the page number for a specific topic. Indexes help in optimizing SELECT queries but may slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

            In this section, we'll cover different types of indexes, including primary, clustered, secondary, and key/non-key indexes. We'll also explore numerical examples of index cost and how indexing impacts performance.

        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üìä Types of Indexes</h2>
          <p>
            There are different types of indexes, each serving different purposes. The main types include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Primary Index</strong>: An index created on the primary key of a table. It uniquely identifies each record in the table.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clustered Index</strong>: The data rows in the table are stored in the same order as the clustered index. Each table can have only one clustered index.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Secondary Index</strong>: An index that provides a way to quickly search non-primary key columns. A table can have multiple secondary indexes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Index</strong>: An index created on the key columns of a table. It can be either a primary or secondary index.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-Key Index</strong>: An index created on non-key columns to improve query performance when the query searches those columns.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        {/* Primary Index and Clustered Index */}
        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üîë Primary and Clustered Indexes</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>primary index</strong> is created on the primary key column, which uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is usually implemented as a clustered index. A <strong>clustered index</strong> determines the physical order of data in the table, which means that the data rows are sorted in the same order as the index.
          </p>
          <h3>Example of Primary and Clustered Index:</h3>
          <pre>
{`Table: Employee
+------------+----------+
| Emp_ID     | Name     |
+------------+----------+
| 101        | Alice    |
| 102        | Bob      |
| 103        | Charlie  |
+------------+----------+
Primary Index: Emp_ID (Clustered Index)
`}
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here, the primary key is Emp_ID, and the clustered index will arrange the data in ascending order based on the Emp_ID. Since the data is physically stored in this order, the primary index is also clustered.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Secondary Index */}
        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üîç Secondary Index</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>secondary index</strong> is used to create an index on columns that are not the primary key. Secondary indexes are helpful when you need to frequently query non-key columns. Unlike primary indexes, secondary indexes do not affect the physical storage of the data in the table.
          </p>
          <h3>Example of Secondary Index:</h3>
          <pre>
{`Table: Employee
+------------+----------+---------+
| Emp_ID     | Name     | Dept_ID |
+------------+----------+---------+
| 101        | Alice    | 10      |
| 102        | Bob      | 20      |
| 103        | Charlie  | 10      |
+------------+----------+---------+
Secondary Index: Dept_ID (Non-clustered)
`}
          </pre>
          <p>
            In this example, a secondary index is created on the Dept_ID column to improve query performance when searching employees by department. The secondary index is non-clustered, meaning the data is not physically stored in the order of the index.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Numerical Example of Index Cost */}
        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üí∞ Numerical Example of Index Cost</h2>
          <p>
            The cost of an index is typically measured in terms of the number of disk I/O operations required to fetch data. Let's consider a table of 1 million rows and examine the cost of a query with and without an index.
          </p>
          <h3>Example: Index Cost Calculation</h3>
          <pre>
{`Without Index:
- For a full table scan, the cost will be proportional to the number of rows, which is 1 million rows.
- Cost = 1 million I/O operations.

With Index (assuming a B-Tree index):
- For a query on an indexed column, the cost is proportional to the height of the B-Tree, which is logarithmic.
- Cost = log2(1 million) = 20 I/O operations.
`}
          </pre>
          <p>
            As we can see, the index significantly reduces the number of I/O operations required to fetch the data, improving query performance.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Diagram for Indexing */}
        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üìä Diagram of Indexing</h2>
          <p>
            Below is a simple diagram illustrating how indexing works in a B-Tree structure. The B-Tree index helps reduce the time complexity of searching for records.
          </p>
          <pre>
            {`
              B-Tree Index (Dept_ID)
                Root
               |   |
             10     20
            |  |   |  |
           1   5  15  25
            `}
          </pre>
          <p>
            In this B-Tree index, the values on the left branch correspond to records with Dept_ID 10, and those on the right correspond to Dept_ID 20. This structure allows fast access to data based on the index value.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Key vs Non-Key Index */}
        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üóù Key vs Non-Key Index</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>key index</strong> is an index that is created on a key column (either primary or unique). A <strong>non-key index</strong> is created on a non-key column to improve query performance on columns that are not part of the key.
          </p>
          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <pre>
{`Table: Employee
+------------+----------+---------+
| Emp_ID     | Name     | Dept_ID |
+------------+----------+---------+
| 101        | Alice    | 10      |
| 102        | Bob      | 20      |
+------------+----------+---------+

Key Index: Emp_ID (Primary key)
Non-Key Index: Dept_ID (Secondary index)
`}
          </pre>
          <p>
            In this example, the Emp_ID is indexed as a key index (primary key), while the Dept_ID is indexed as a non-key index to facilitate fast searches by department.
          </p>
        </div>

        {/* Conclusion */}
        <div className="dbms-section">
          <h2 className="dbms-subtitle">üìö Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Indexing plays a vital role in optimizing query performance in databases. The choice of index type, whether primary, clustered, secondary, key, or non-key, depends on the specific needs of the database and the queries it serves. Understanding how indexing impacts query performance is essential for building efficient database systems.
